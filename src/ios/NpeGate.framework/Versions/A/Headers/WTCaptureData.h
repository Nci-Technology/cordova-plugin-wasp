/**
 * The WTCaptureData is an opbject used to store session data from a specific parameter
 * for an ANT+ sensor.
 *
 * The Cature Data object has two arrays, one for storing the data being captured, and the
 * other is for saving the timestamp associated with each sample.
 *
 * Methods are provided to add data, reset the storage, start/stop capture and add a lap
 * timestamp to the data
 *
 * This object is provided to allow very low overhead for storing sensor specific data without
 * burdoning the application with saving the data at a higher level in the application.
